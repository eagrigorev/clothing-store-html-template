## Clothing Store HTML Template

This is a responsive multi-page website that looks good on a desktop, tablet and phone. I also added a simple JavaScript menu that sticks to the right side of the screen. For that project, I made all the responsive pages and animated one of the product cards. I decided to stick with only one card as that project was purely educational, but this is enough to show the templateâ€™s functionality.
