# clothing-store-template

A multipage HTML template for a clothing store.

Figma template: https://www.figma.com/file/P6G1VYCw2ppqNAiTxlWkZP/Clothing-Store-Template?node-id=0%3A1.

I made this clothing store template with HTML and CSS/SCSS technologies only. I also added a simple JavaScript menu that sticks to the right side of the screen. This multipage template was a part of my advanced HTML course. The project curator provided a Figma template for free.

For that project, I made all the responsive pages and also animated one of the product cards. I decided to stick with only one card as that project was purely educational, but this is enough to show the templateâ€™s functionality. The biggest issue with that template was animating toggleable and dropdown menus using CSS only and figuring out all media rules for different devices.
